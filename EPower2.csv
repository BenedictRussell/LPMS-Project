THE SLACK ON THE CONSTRAINTS FOR THE BASE CASE:

The slack on the Sulphur constraint is 0
This corresponds to a fair price of Sulphur of 0
The slack on the CO2 constraint is 0
This corresponds to a fair price of CO2 of 90.625

The sources and time periods where the slack on the maximum output constraint is zero and the corresponding fairprice
Nuclear in time period 1 has fair price 350
Nuclear in time period 2 has fair price 0
Nuclear in time period 3 has fair price 400
Nuclear in time period 4 has fair price 250
Nuclear in time period 5 has fair price 100
